I'd like to reserve a hotel room.
That should be no problem. May I have your full name, please?
My name is John Sandals.
Hello, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days do you need that reservation, sir?
I'm planning to visit New York from Friday, April 14 until Monday, April 17. 
Our room rates recently went up. Is that okay with you, Mr. Sandals?
How much per night are we talking about?
Each night will be $308.
That price is perfectly acceptable.
Wonderful! Do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room?
Nonsmoking, please.
Next question: Is a queen-size bed okay?
Queen-size sounds fine to me.
Okay, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is in our computer. All we need now is a phone number.
Certainly. My phone number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to seeing you here!

Hi there, I want to reserve a hotel room.
No problem at all. Could I have your full name, please?
Sure, John Sandals.
Hi, Mr. Sandals. I'm Papaya, at your service. When do you need the room? 
My plans are to be there April 14th to the 17th. 
We have new room rates, sir. Will that be acceptable to you?
It depends on the price, of course. What is it?
It's $308 a night.
I have no problem with that.
Great! Would you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Definitely nonsmoking. I can't handle that smell.
Nonsmoking. Now, is a queen-size bed okay?
No problem. Queen-size sounds good to me.
Great, Mr. Sandals. Your reservation is confirmed. Now all I need is your phone number.
Of course! It's area code 305-555-1788.
Thank you so much, Mr. Sandals. We look forward to seeing you!

I need to reserve a room.
Not a problem. May I have your name, please?
Of course. I'm John Sandals.
Hi, sir. My name is Papaya. Could you tell me when you need the room?
Right now. I plan to be there in April from the 14th to the 17th. 
Perhaps you didn't know that we have new room rates. Do you find that acceptable, sir?
Maybe. How much is a room?
The price per night is $308.
That sounds fine to me.
Fantastic! Would you like a smoking or nonsmoking room?
I hate cigarettes! Nonsmoking.
That'll be nonsmoking. Now, do you approve of a single queen-size bed?
That'll be no problem.
I'm happy to hear that, sir. Your reservation is all set except for your phone number.
Sure! My number is 305-555-1788.
Thank you for doing business with us, Mr. Sandals.

I need a hotel room.
That's no problem at all. May I have your name, please?
Certainly. My name is John Sandals.
It's a pleasure, Mr. Sandals. My name is Papaya. What days will you need a room?
Friday afternoon, April 14 through Monday morning, April 17.
One minor problem, sir. Our prices are now slightly higher. Is that acceptable, sir?
Please tell me the price, so I can make a decision.
It'll be $308 nightly.
That's a reasonable price.
Good! Now, sir, do you have a preference for smoking or nonsmoking?
I quit smoking, so nonsmoking.
I hear you, sir. Nonsmoking. Now, about the bed, is a queen-size okay?
A queen sounds great.
Okay, sir, let me reserve those dates, there. Now, if you'll just tell me your phone number.
That would be 305-555-1788.
Ok, I got it. Thank you so much for choosing our hotel, sir!

I need a room for a few days.
That won't be a problem. Could you please tell me your name?
My name is John Sandals.
Sir, I'm Papaya, and I run the front desk. Please tell me the days you'll be here.
I'll be there in April: Friday through Monday, the 14th through the 17th.
We recently changed many things here, sir, including our prices. Do you mind, sir?
Possibly. What's the actual price?
The price will be $308 a night.
That price is not bad for me.
Very good. Now, Mr. Sandals, about the room, smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, definitely! 
Most of our clients prefer nonsmoking. Now, does a queen sound okay?
Yes, that'll be just fine.
One more second, sir. Your reservation is now verified, so all I need is your phone number.
It's 305-555-1788.
Okay, sir, we look forward to seeing you in April!

Can I reserve a hotel room? 
I assure you, that's not a problem. What is your full name, please? 
My name's John Sandals.
It's a pleasure to assist you. Please tell me when you'll be needing the room, sir.
If my plans don't change, I'll need a room April 14 till April 17.
Sir, our room prices are slightly higher than you may have thought. Will that be okay?
Tell me how much it will be, and I can tell you if it's okay.
Only $308 per night, before taxes, of course.
$308 a night? That's a fair price.
Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?
Nonsmoking, please.
Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?
I have absolutely no problem with that.
Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just give me your phone number. 
Not a problem. The number is 305-555-1788.
